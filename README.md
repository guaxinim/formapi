## FormAPI Project

Basic AngularJs + JEE6 app to demonstrate between applications and JBoss KeyCloak SSO

Promotes Roles/Users Management via KeyCloak REST API

The idea of FormAPI is to use KeyCloak to abstract all SSO Management and create a central point to deal with it.

There's an Active Directory Database with federated data in KeyCloak repository.
