## FormAPI Project

Basic AngularJs + JEE6 app to demonstrate the integration between application and JBoss KeyCloak SSO

Promotes Roles/Users Management via KeyCloak REST API

The idea of FormAPI is to use KeyCloak to abstract all SSO Management and create a central point to deal with Users/Roles of all applications in the ecosystem.

There's an Active Directory Database with federated data already configured in KeyCloak repository.
